This website exists because it’s imperative that we change the way our cities are built and governed — not least Toronto. 

The methods by which we manage growth, distribute wealth, facilitate livelihood, exist sustainably, and build meaningful places to inhabit — all things that most Torontonians care deeply about — are intrinsically interlinked. By studying precisely how they are connected and unraveling those relationships so that it becomes clear how, for instance, by building more high-capacity transit we can encourage the independence of youth and seniors, we can begin to make informed decisions about how we choose to live and what we want to value as an urban society. 

On this website you will find my musings on these issues — supplemented by a healthy dose of photography — in addition to a project that I’m currently calling the Transit Network Project. The mapping, the photos, and the writing are all the culmination of my time studying both urban and political issues at Queen’s and YouTube University along with countless opportunities to learn first-hand from people in a variety of related industries, travel within Canada and abroad, and continued learning through a variety of methods.
